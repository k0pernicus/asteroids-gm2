# Asteroids

This is a first attempt to use GameMaker Studio 2 to create a game.

This game is basically an "Asteroids" game, with some augmentations.

The code is not great... but, hey, this is my first attempt :)

## How to play

Download Game Maker Studio 2, open the projet, and click on "Play".

## Will be there any build in the future?

Maybe... If I buy a license to export the project sometimes.

## Does it runs on X ?

I only tried it on Windows 10 / 11, nothing more (no mac, no Linux...).  
But, please, do not hesitate to try on your own machine and propose changes.
